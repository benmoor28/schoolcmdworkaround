# schoolcmdworkaround
This will allow you to run commands in school if the CMD is blocked! (Requires the school to have python installed)

<h3>Steps</h3>

After you have saved your python file, right click it and run through the python terminal, NOT with idle, it will not look as impressive and some things may not work.

Do not run commands where it would need an input after you run it. For example netsh, in the normal cmd if you were to type in netsh and press enter, then it would open a netsh command line. If you wanted to run the netsh command, you have to put it in full.

So instead of running "netsh", then "int ip reset", you would just run the whole command like this, "netsh int ip reset".
